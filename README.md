# RStudio_RNAseq_Zebrafish_Treatment_Anlaysis
RNA-Seq analysis of 3 experimental Zebrafish groups

Zebrafish RNA-Seq data was used in this analysis. 

This R script analyzes your RNA-Seq data to find out which biological pathways are changing between 3 experimental samples (Treatment A, Combined Treatment(A and B) and Control Group). Instead of just looking at individual genes, it groups them into biological processes.

Outputs of three comparisons were made(TvC,TvN,CvN):

Dot Plots: Shows which pathways are "Activated" (red/positive) or "Suppressed" (blue/negative).

Bar Plots: A simple ranking of the most significant biological processes.

Upset Plots: Shows if the same genes are involved in multiple different pathways. 

Network Maps (Cnet/Emap): Complex webs showing how genes and pathways connect to each other.
